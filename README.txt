How to run:

1) Go to the ./CMake
2) Change the relevant (marked) paths inside CMakeLists.txt
3) run 'cmake .'
4) compile with 'COMPILE.sh'
5) to run the script and have the correct path for the files, do it from the ./CMake folder by either:
	./RUN_EXEC.sh (to run only)
	./COMPILE_AND_RUN.sh (first compile than run)
6) any output will be in CATS_TUTORIAL_2019/OutputFiles
